LD #33 -- Theme: You Are the Monster

# Game Concept (2) -- SeaMonmster Snake

Standard snake game -- you are the snake, eating stuff that periodically
appers, but don't eat your own talk.  In this version, we'll make the
edible stuff surface ships (maybe of various types), and the snake can
ascend or descend into the water.

# Techincal Appraoch

 * Angular
 * SVG
 * Maybe a touch of microservices for things like high scores, etc

# Why the (2)?  

Once again, I started out with something a little too ambitious (a
multi-player card game), and ran out of time on that track, only getting to
the point where game instacnes could be created and joined by the end of
Saturdady.

So this is another LD in eight hour things...
